// This is a constant file that contains all the colors used in the app.
// It is a good practice to keep all the colors in one place so that they can be reused throughout the app.
// This makes it easier to maintain the app and change the colors if needed.
// The colors are stored as key-value pairs in an object.
//  The key is the name of the color, and the value is the hex code of the color.
// The colors can be accessed by importing the Colors object and using the key to get the color value.
// For example, Colors.primary500 will return the hex code of the primary color used in the app.
//  This makes it easier to change the color in one place and have it reflected throughout the app.
// for this work we import the Colors.js folder in the app.js file and everywhere it'll be used,
//  use the Colors.primary500 to get the color value.
